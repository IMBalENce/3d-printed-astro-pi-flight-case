# 3D Printed Astro Pi Flight Case

![](cover.png)

The Astro Pi flight case is one of the most desired cases in the history of the Raspberry Pi. With this resource you will learn how to 3D print your own case and install the Astro Pi hardware inside it. You'll then have your very own Astro Pi flight unit identical in almost every way to the ones on the International Space Station right now.

If you're participating in an Astro Pi competition this is a great way to prototype and ergonomically test your code in the same way as it would be used by the crew of the ISS.

## Get access to a 3D printer

First and foremost you'll need access to a 3D printer to do this. Many schools now have their own but if your school doesn't then you may be able to find one at your local [hackspace](http://www.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Main_Page). You can also find local 3D printing services through the [3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/) website.

## Get the 3D files

The 3D files are in [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29) format which is widely used for 3D printing all over the world. The software for your 3D printer will have no problem loading it.
